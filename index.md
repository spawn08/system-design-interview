# System Design Interview Guide
{: .fs-9 }

Your comprehensive resource for mastering system design interviews, whether you're targeting Senior Software Engineer roles or ML/GenAI positions.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

## 👋 Welcome!

System design interviews can feel overwhelming. There's so much to know: databases, caching, load balancing, distributed systems... Where do you even start?

**This guide breaks it down for you.**

We take complex systems and explain them step-by-step, from "what is this?" all the way to "how do I design it at scale?"

---

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

| You Are | You'll Learn |
|---------|--------------|
| **Software Engineer** preparing for FAANG interviews | Core system design patterns and trade-offs |
| **ML/AI Engineer** designing production systems | ML-specific architectures and serving patterns |
| **Student or Junior Dev** wanting to level up | Foundational concepts with clear explanations |
| **Experienced Engineer** needing a refresher | Quick reference for common patterns |

---

## 📚 What's Inside

### [Fundamentals](basics/)
Start here if you're new to system design. Learn the building blocks that appear in every design.

- **Load Balancing** - Distribute traffic across servers
- **Caching** - Speed up reads with in-memory storage
- **Databases** - SQL vs NoSQL, ACID, CAP theorem
- **Networking** - TCP/UDP, HTTP, DNS, WebSockets
- **Concurrency** - Threads, locks, async patterns

### [System Design Examples](software_system_design/)
Step-by-step walkthroughs of classic interview questions.

- **URL Shortener** - Design TinyURL or Bitly
- **Voting System** - Build a scalable polling platform

### [ML System Design](ml_system_design/)
Specialized designs for machine learning and AI systems.

- **Image Caption Generator** - ML pipeline from ingestion to inference

---

## 🚀 How to Use This Guide

### If You Have 1 Week

1. Read through [Load Balancing](basics/load_balancer.md) to understand fundamentals
2. Study [URL Shortener](software_system_design/url_shortening.md) - it's asked frequently
3. Practice explaining the design out loud

### If You Have 1 Month

1. Master all fundamentals in the Basics section
2. Work through each system design example
3. Draw diagrams from memory
4. Mock interview with a friend

### During Your Interview

1. **Clarify requirements** (5 min) - Don't assume!
2. **High-level design** (10 min) - Draw the big picture
3. **Deep dive** (15 min) - Focus on 2-3 components
4. **Wrap up** (5 min) - Discuss trade-offs and improvements

## 💡 Key Tips

{: .note }
> **Always ask clarifying questions.** The interviewer wants to see how you think, not just what you know.

{: .tip }
> **Draw diagrams.** A picture is worth a thousand words in system design.

{: .warning }
> **Don't jump to solutions.** Understand the problem before proposing architecture.

## 📖 Quick Reference: Essential Topics

Every system design interview touches on these concepts:

| Topic | What to Know |
|-------|--------------|
| **Load Balancing** | Round robin, least connections, health checks |
| **Caching** | Redis/Memcached, cache invalidation, TTL |
| **Databases** | SQL vs NoSQL, sharding, replication |
| **Message Queues** | Kafka, RabbitMQ, async processing |
| **API Design** | REST, rate limiting, authentication |
| **Scaling** | Horizontal vs vertical, auto-scaling |
